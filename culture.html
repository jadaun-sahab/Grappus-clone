               <h4>Why do we need a</h4>
               <h1>Culture code?</h1>
               <p>It all began in 2013, when we fearlessly set out to make great products. We soon realised that we
                    first needed to build a place that can foster greatness. A place that empowers incredibly talented
                    people to put out their best work, with nothing in the way. And for the first couple of years,
                    things went pretty well. But as we grew from 10, 20, to a team of over 50, new hires started feeling
                    lost and isolated, their first few days were stressful. No matter our intentions, growth made things
                    difficult - people didn't know each other as well, information got harder to find, stuff got lost,
                    communication became muddled, and it got harder to stay on top of everything that's going on.</p>
               <p>And so we thought we should put down our beliefs, our values, our culture, who we are and what we
                    stand for, into something tangible. It was time for a culture code, that tends to cover what we
                    strive to be (not what we already are). And hence, a code that’s ever-evolving. Sometimes, the stuff
                    outlined here won’t match perfectly with how things are going day to day. But that’s okay. We’re
                    confident that even when problems persist for a while, Grappus will root them out.</p>

               <h1>Grappus</h1>
               <p>Grappus is a human experience design & development studio, with a reputation for doing things
                    differently. We think the world right now is very boring. We are here to take the risk and try to
                    change it. At the core of it, we help companies understand, prototype and deploy custom
                    technologies. We grow product ideas from napkin sketches to high-quality shipped products within a
                    short space of time. Mostly, we’re a company full of passionate people who love the products we
                    create. A place where hustle meets heart.</p>
               <p>And so we thought we should put down our beliefs, our Working at Grappus provides an opportunity for
                    extremely efficient and, in many cases, very accelerated career growth. In particular, it provides
                    an opportunity to broaden one’s skill set, well outside the narrow constraints that careers can have
                    at most other companies. Here, the “growth ladder” is tailored to you. It operates exactly as fast
                    as you can manage to grow.</p>

               <h2>World-class</h2>
               <h3>experts within a more narrow discipline.</h3>
               <p>Because of the talent diversity here at Grappus, it’s often easier to become stronger at things that
                    aren’t your core skill set.</p>

               <h1>We are</h1>
               <h2>Lean</h2>
               <p>Complicated hierarchies, stringent processes and traditional managers, that were once key to agencies’
                    successes are now exactly what’s putting them in the ground. We use design sprints and agile
                    development to cut the fat out of the standard process and launch products faster, so we can learn
                    from real user data, not guesswork.</p>
               <h2>Fluid.</h2>
               <p>We’re in a fluid world, where we don’t know what technologies we’ll be using next, or what type of
                    projects we’ll be doing. Grappus is an ongoing experiment and you’re part of it. We embrace this
                    uncertainty.</p>
               <h2>Self-funded.</h2>
               <p>We haven’t ever brought in outside financing. Since our earliest days this has been incredibly
                    important in providing us freedom to shape the company.</p>

                    <p>Whenever you speak - internally or externally - speak directly and fearlessly, without any hidden agendas. We make uncommon levels of information available to everyone in the company — it’s really on you to spot the broken ways.</p>

                    <p>We’re creating a safe space for dangerous ideas. We are here to play, to stir things up, to make waves. We don’t look at the industry for the way forward. Since day one, we’ve done things our way — even if that makes some people uncomfortable.</p>

                    <p>The myth of the lone genius inventor with eureka moments is just that: a myth. Innovation happens when teams of people from diverse backgrounds come together, challenging each other to spark great ideas - without focusing on who thought of them.</p>

                    <p>Lasting innovation doesn’t happen when you’re scrambling to meet short-term targets. Take risks, and pursue audacious ideas. Reframe each failure as an opportunity to learn. If there is a way, find it. If there really is no way, make sure there’s no doubt.</p>

          <h1>First Day</h1>
          <h3>& beyond</h3>
          <p>Ok, you feel a little stupid. Temporarily of course, but for now you can’t remember the name of the person sitting next to you, or why your password won’t work or where you’re supposed to be next or where the bathroom/coffee/stairwell/anything is but you’re smiling all the time because hey, it’s your first day! You’ve set up most of your accounts, and you got your fingerprint scanned in the fingerprint thingy, and you’ve had lunch with the team and everybody’s cool, and you actually remembered that the door is a pull instead of a push and by the time you leave you realise you just started a really great part of your life because this place is pretty cool. And you’re not stupid at all :)</p>
          <p>Getting started at Grappus can be overwhelming. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you're learning a new job with new coworkers. If you are new to Grappus, welcome. It’s really on you to spot the broken ways. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been here for a while. Take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.</p>
          <p>“Be a sponge” and absorb everything. Get to know your company’s culture, working & communication style. Soon you can stop feeling the need to introduce yourself. You can also stop wondering if they’re all whispering about you. They’re not. And maybe it’s time you started showing off some of those quirky habits. Wear the funky shirt and cowboy hat. Bring-in the skull shaped coffee mug. Unveil those glow-in-the-dark headphones. You’re one of us. It’s what makes us all interesting!</p>
          <p>Ask a lot of questions. To anyone, really. When you do, you’ll find out what’s going on around the company and your peers will also find out about you. Lots of people at Grappus want and need to know what you care about, what you’re good at, what you’re worried about, what you’ve got experience with, and so on. And the way to get the word out is to start telling people all of those things. So, while you’re getting the lay of the land by learning about projects, you’re also broadcasting your own status to a relevant group of people.</p>

          <h1>How we work</h1>
          <p>Work is a bad word to explain what we do. If what you are doing seems like work, you’re either in the wrong industry or you’re not doing it right. Your time here should feel less like digging a ditch and more like a challenging game of chess. We’re all moving this place forward. We like to take risks. We like to try new things. We like to work in a world free of judgement and let laughter become our driver. We don’t take ourselves too seriously. No matter the gravity of the situation, we’ll make sure to find the humor in it. A hearty laugh is worth ten cups of coffee!</p>
          <p>We don’t generate unused reports, we cancel unproductive meetings, we remove unnecessary rules & restrictions, we identify and automate all manual processes. We’ve identified that the fastest way to kill a collaborative environment is through politics, sects, packs, niches, groups, exclusion and things that build walls between people. And since we are all about collaboration, you can see why walls and separation would be a problem.</p>
          <p>We ask that you don’t throw pens, Be selfish, Talk shit, Duck responsibility, Play the busy card, Leave others hanging, Make excuses, Disappear, Make promises you can’t keep. Say it can’t be done. We get shit done. We don’t talk about it, or have a meeting about it, or email each other about it if we’re not going to do it. Brilliant thinking not executed, is literally worthless. You are in the game here. There are no sidelines.</p>
          <h3>#1 - Nobody’s gonna hold your hand</h3>
          <p>At Grappus, you’re given an incredible amount of freedom and autonomy. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, but don’t rely on others to hold your hand. It’s up to you to figure out how to approach a problem. If you want to update, change, or fix something, go for it. Seriously. Every awesome thing you see is like that because someone like you decided to do it.</p>
          <h3>#2 - We aren’t big on hierarchy</h3>
