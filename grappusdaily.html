                         <p>To design happiness, you need to keep a few things in mind. First, happiness is the
                              anticipation of an event or the memory of it. Second, you need a moment of transition to
                              escape the unhappy real world. Third, bureaucracy is anti-happiness, people need to feel
                              empowered to be happy. Fourth, surprising people is the key to delight, and it is
                              mundanely easy. And fifth, it’s important to remember that we come from nature and it
                              knows happiness best.</p>

                         <h1>How digital technology is influencing the world of design</h1>
                         <p>It's interesting to combine different areas of technology that perhaps they haven't met
                              before, and you can see how it can be a collaboration between the ideas of the designer
                              and different types of technology. While technology plays an important role in the
                              workings of Front's designs, the art of collaboration is where they are truly innovative.
